<!-- CONNECT FOUR
As users playing a two player game we want to:

enter our names and have them displayed
have our order chosen for us by the game
take turns by dropping our chip into a column on the grid
not be able to drop a chip into a totally filled column
be told when a move causes a player to win, or to draw
start the game over without having to reset the browser
As a user playing a single player game I additionally want to:

see the name 'Computer' displayed as my opponent
have the Computer player choose columns as if it were a human player
As a user playing a single player game I would be delighted if:

the Computer chooses the correct column for a win, when possible -->
